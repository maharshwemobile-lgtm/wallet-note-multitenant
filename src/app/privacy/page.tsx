            We store account details you provide, including your name, username, email,
            optional phone number, business details, and password in hashed form. We also
            store the wallet records, contacts, sales, purchases, inventory, credit records,

          <p className="mt-2">
            Data is used to provide the app, secure accounts, keep business records, and
            troubleshoot service problems. Each business has a separate workspace. Data is
            transmitted over HTTPS and stored in a protected PostgreSQL database. We do not
            sell personal data or use advertising SDKs.

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold">Sharing and retention</h2>
          <p className="mt-2">
            We do not share workspace data with other registered businesses. Service
            infrastructure providers may process data only as needed to host and operate the
            app. Data is retained while the account is active and is deleted after a verified
            account deletion request is completed, except where limited retention is required
            for security, fraud prevention, or legal obligations.
