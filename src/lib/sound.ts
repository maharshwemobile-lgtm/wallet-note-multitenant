 *
 *  The tones are generated rather than loaded. A shop counter runs on a phone with a
 *  patchy connection, and a sound file that has not downloaded is a sound that does not
 *  play at the one moment it matters — and nothing has to be added to the offline cache.
 *
 *  Never throws. Audio is not allowed before a page has been interacted with, and some
 *  devices refuse it outright; a sale must not fail because a beep could not.
